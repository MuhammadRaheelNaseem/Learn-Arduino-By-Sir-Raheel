# Learn-Arduino-By-Sir-Raheel
Arduino is a prototype platform (open-source) based on an easy-to-use hardware and software. It consists of a circuit board, which can be programed (referred to as a microcontroller) and a ready-made software called Arduino. Arduino boards are able to read input signals from different sensors and turn it into an output such as activating a motor, turning LED on/off, connect to the cloud and many other actions.

# `Introduction`
Arduino is an open-source platform used for building electronics projects. It consists of a physical programmable circuit board and a piece of software that runs on your computer. The Arduino does not need a separate piece of hardware in order to load new code onto the board -- you can simply use a USB cable.

# `Let's start downloading and installation of Arduino IDE Software:`
`Arduino IDE` is software for progaming Arduino Board. This software is used as a `text editor` to create, open, edit, and validate Code for Arduino. The Code or Program in Arduino is called `"sketch"`.

Beside the text editor, This application is also include :

`Compailer `: to make sure the sketch is correct
`Uploader `: to upload sketch to the arduino boards
This application will be used to create arduino projects which I will post in the next article.

Let' start.

# `Step 1: Download File Arduino IDE:`

Click the link below to download the Software :

https://www.arduino.cc/en/software

On that page, there are 3 download options for Windows.

`Windows Installer `: The software will be installed in Windows operating system and required admin access.
`Windows Zip file `: To make a portable installation.
`Windows App `: for Windows 8.1 or 10.
I suggest the first option. because it directly install all your needs to use the Arduino IDE Software, and include drivers for the the Arduino board. If you choose the Zip file you need to install the driver manually.

Click Windows Installer, then click `"just download"` or `"Contribute & Download"`.

After the download is complete, open the installer file and start installing.

# `Step 2: License Agreement:`
After the file is run, the "License Agreement" page will apper. You can read it, then click "I Agree" to continue.

# `Step 3: Installation Option`
Check the component that you want to install and uncheck the components that you don't want to install. I suggest installing all componen. Click "next" to continue.

# `Step 4: Installation Folder`
Arduino will automatically be installed in "C:\Program Files (x86)\Arduino". If you want to change the folder, click "Browse" and select the desired folder. Click install to start the installation.

# `Step 6: Installation Complete:`
If there is written "complete", it means that the isntallation process is complete. click "Close".

# `Step 7: Open Arduino IDE:`
After the installation process is complete, there will be an Arduino icon on the Desktop. Or check on the search icon and write "arduino". If you have found the arduino icon, run the application.

# `Step 8: Display Arduino IDE:`
This is a display of the Arduino IDE Software. The application is ready to be used to create amazing projects. Wait for my next article about a simple project using arduino.
